# About Me
Hi! I'm Oleksandr (Sashka_UA_1) — a Front-End Developer.
I'm 24 years old and love diving into other people's code to learn something new. I grow by analyzing mistakes and helping to find effective solutions to different tasks.
# My Current Tech Stack:
- HTML – page structure
- CSS – styles and layout
- JavaScript – interactivity
- SCSS – enhanced CSS
- React – modern library for building user interfaces
- But I’m not stopping here — currently learning React

# My Code Editor
I use Visual Studio Code as my primary development tool.
## Favorite Extensions:
- Auto Close Tag
- Auto Rename Tag
- CSS Peek
- Error Lens
- HTML CSS Support
- HTML to CSS Autocompletion
- Image Preview
- Live Sass Compiler
- Live Server
- px to rem
